59. Given the source code for an AWS Lambda function in the local `store.py` containing a handler function called `get_store` and the following AWS CloudFormation template. What should be done to prepare the template so that it can be deployed using the AWS CLI command `aws cloudformation deploy`?

![Question 59](images/question59.jpg)

- [ ] Use AWS CloudFormation compile to base64 encode and embed the source file into a modified CloudFormation template.
- [x] Use AWS CloudFormation package to upload the source code to an Amazon S3 bucket and produce a modified CloudFormation template.
- [ ] Use AWS Lambda zip to package the source file together with the CloudFormation template and deploy the resulting zip archive.
- [ ] Use AWS Serverless `create-package` to embed the source file directly into the existing CloudFormation template.
